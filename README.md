Saturday I spent whole day reading again into react/redux. Trying to get a grip.
Today I got off on a good start, but at the end I got into some errors. Good not fix them all unfortunately.
There's no CSS as I couldn't see the app because of the error.
Overall I think I get the Redux part, but thought it was really hard to try it for real by myself.
Anyway, looking forward to the project week and put all again in action.
