## The Hangman Game using React-redux:
> Assigment made for Codaissuer

### To run this project:
* Clone the repo.
* Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
* Run `yarn start`.

### Structure of the app:
- The folder lib contains game logic.
- In actions folder I imported the randomWord function of the logic and exported the 2 actions (NewGame and makeGuess).
- Passed those actions to the reducers, one for the game and another for the guesses.
- The components, hangman for the total game and letters for each guess.
- One container for the componets (Board) which is passed to the App.js.

### To Do:
1. Fixing the problem when submiting a number or a letter twice.
2. Adding some nice styling
=======
Saturday I spent whole day reading again into react/redux. Trying to get a grip and do the setup and startup.
Today I got off on a good start, but at the end I got into some errors. Good not fix them all unfortunately.
There's no CSS as I couldn't see the app because of the error.
Overall I think I get the Redux part, but thought it was really hard to try it for real by myself.
Anyway, looking forward to the project week and put all again in action.

I created a new repository as I ran into trouble on the old one with pushing. So the timestamps are since creating this one. Did not start at that time
